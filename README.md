## About this Project

Action Coin (“Action” or “ACTN”) is earned by joining our website, and participating in community activities (such as mining and staking).

Collectors may use their Action Coin to obtain deals and discounts (1.00 ACTN = $1.00 USD in SAVINGS) on a growing list of products and services offered by Vendors from more than 30 countries.

## Getting started

Detailed instructions coming soon.

### Dependencies

```shell
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl libsodium-dev
```

### Build

This software is based on zcash and considered experimental and is continously undergoing heavy development.

The dev branch is considered the bleeding edge codebase while the master-branch is considered tested (unit tests, runtime tests, functionality). At no point of time does Action Coin Inc., or the Komodo Platform developers take any responsbility for any damage out of the usage of this software. 
This software builds for all operating systems out of the same codebase. Follow the OS specific instructions from below.

#### Linux

```shell
git clone https://github.com/actioncoininc/action-komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(expr $(nproc) - 1)
#This can take some time.
```

#### OSX

Ensure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and Command Line Tools installed.
```shell
# Install brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# Install Xcode, opens a pop-up window to install CLT without installing the entire Xcode package
xcode-select --install 
# Update brew and install dependencies
brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap discoteq/discoteq; brew install flock
brew install autoconf autogen automake
brew update && brew install gcc@8
brew install binutils
brew install protobuf
brew install coreutils
brew install wget
# Clone the Action Coin repo
git clone https://github.com/actioncoin/action-komodo --branch master --single-branch
# Change master branch to other branch you wish to compile
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j$(expr $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) - 1)
# This can take some time.
```

#### Windows

Use a debian cross-compilation setup with mingw for windows and run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl cmake mingw-w64 libsodium-dev libevent-dev
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build-win.sh -j$(expr $(nproc) - 1)
#This can take some time.
```
**komodo is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.

To reset the Komodo blockchain change into the *~/.komodo* data directory and delete the corresponding files by running `rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log komodostate db.log`


**This software is based on Zcash which is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.

There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run komodod with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.

**To change modes:**

a) backup all privkeys (launch komodod with `-exportdir=<path>` and `dumpwallet`)  
b) start a totally new sync including `wallet.dat`, launch with same `exportdir`  
c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using `komodo-cli importwallet filename`  
d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip  

For example:
```shell
./komodod -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli dumpwallet example
./komodo-cli stop
mv ~/.komodo ~/.komodo.old && mkdir ~/.komodo && cp ~/.komodo.old/komodo.conf ~/.komodo.old/peers.dat ~/.komodo
./komodod -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli importwallet /tmp/example
```
